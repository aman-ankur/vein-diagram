SGOT/SGPT- RATIO

Total bilirubin is invariably increased in jaundice. Causes of jaundice are prehepatic, resulting from various hemolytic 
diseases; hepatic, resulting from hepatocellular injury or obstruction; and posthepatic, resulting from obstruction of the 
hepatic or common bile ducts.
Aspartate aminotransferase is present in high activity in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. Increased serum AST activity 
commonly follows myocardial infarction, pulmonary emboli, skeletal muscle trauma, alcoholic cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, 
and drug-induced hepatitis.
Alanine aminotransferase is present in high activity in liver, skeletal muscle, heart, and kidney. Serum ALT increases 
rapidly in liver cell necrosis, hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver tumours, obstructive jaundice, Reye
’
s syndrome, 
extensive trauma to skeletal muscle, myositis, myocarditis, and myocardial infarction.
Alkaline phosphatase is elevated in fever and increased bone metabolism, for example, in adolescents and during the 
healing of a fracture; primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism; Paget
’
s disease of bone; carcinoma metastatic to 
bone; osteogenic sarcoma; and Hodgkin
’
s disease if bones are invaded. Hepatobiliary diseases involving cholestasis, 
inflammation, or cirrhosis increased ALP activity; also increased in renal infarction and failure and in the complications 
of pregnancy. Low ALP activity may occasionally be seen in hypothyroidism.
Serum GGT is a sensitive indicator of hepatobiliary disease and is useful in the diagnosis of obstructive jaundice and 
chronic alcoholic liver disease, in the follow-up of chronic alcoholics undergoing treatment, and in the detection of 
hepatotoxicity. GGT is more responsive to biliary obstruction than AST, ALT, or ALP. 
Total serum protein levels can be used for evaluation of nutritional status. Causes of high total serum protein 
concentration include dehydration, Waldenström
’
s macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, hyperglobulinemia, 
granulomatous diseases, and some tropical diseases. Causes of low total serum protein concentration include 
pregnancy, excessive intravenous fluid administration, cirrhosis or other liver diseases, chronic alcoholism, heart 
failure, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, neoplasia, protein-losing enteropathies, malabsorption, and severe 
malnutrition.

HbA1C is used to monitor fluctuations in blood glucose concentration in the past 8 to 12 week
’
s period.
The reference interval defined as per American Diabetes Association guidelines 2016:
a)     Less than 5.7% : Non Diabetic
b)    5.7 to 6.4% : at increased risk of developing diabetes in the future
c)     More than 6.5% : Diabetic
d)    Therapeutic glycemic target:
i.      Adults: less than 7%
ii.     Children with Type 1 diabetes : less than 7 %
e)     Pregnant diabetic patients : less than 6.5%
Note:
•  
Targets may be individualized based on: Age/life expectancy, Comorbid conditions, Diabetes duration , Hypoglycemia status, 
Individual patient considerations
Reference: American Diabetes Association. Standards of medical care in diabetes
—2021.
Mean Blood Glucose is average Blood glucose which directly correlates with A1C, reported in the same units as blood sugar levels 
(mg/dl). Thus it reflects the average glucose concentration in the past 8 to 12 weeks period. This should not be compared with 
Fasting or Post prandial or random blood sugar which measures glucose concentration at that point of time of testing.

Lipid profile is a group test consisting of various lipids. Lipid profiles are generally collected with overnight fasting. 
However, 
Recent guidelines have 
recommended non fasting samples for lipid profile for assessment of cardiovascular risk.
 The details for the study can be checked at
 
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2733560
In certain instances measurements in the same patient can show physiological and analytical variations. In such cases three serial samples at an interval of 1 
week each are recommended for Total cholesterol, TG, HDL and LDL.
Cholesterol levels
 are increased in primary hypercholesterolemia; secondary hyperlipoproteinemia, including nephrotic syndrome; primary biliary cirrhosis; 
hypothyroidism; and in some cases, diabetes mellitus. Low cholesterol levels may be found in malnutrition, malabsorption, advanced malignancy, and 
hyperthyroidism. 
Triglyceride levels
 are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, liver obstruction, other diseases involving lipid 
metabolism, or various endocrine disorders.
High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels
 is used to evaluate the risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). The risk of CHD increases with 
lower HDL cholesterol concentrations.
 
LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol level
, sometimes called 
“
bad
” 
cholesterol, makes up most of our body
’
s cholesterol. High levels of LDL cholesterol 
raise your risk for heart disease and stroke.
 
Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)
 cholesterol is produced in the liver and released into the bloodstream to supply body tissues with triglycerides. High 
levels of VLDL cholesterol have
been associated with the development of plaque deposits on artery walls, which narrow the passage and restrict blood flow.

Thyroid Stimulating Hormone 
(TSH)

µIU/mL
0.400-4.049
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), also called Thyrotropin is a hormone secreted into the blood by the Pituitary gland (a gland present in the 
brain)). It signals the thyroid gland to make and release the thyroid hormones (T3 & T4) into the blood.
High TSH level
 indicates that the thyroid gland is not making enough thyroid hormone (primary hypothyroidism).
Low TSH level usually
 indicates that the thyroid is producing too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism).
Factors influencing TSH levels
Fasting
: TSH level shows a significant decline after meal intake in comparison to fasting values. This may have clinical implications in the 
diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism, especially Subclinical hypothyroidism.
1
Circadian Rhythm:
 TSH levels follow a circadian variation, reaching peak levels between Morning 2 
– 4 
am and at a minimum between Evening 6-
10 pm. The variation is of the order of 50%. hence time of sample collection during a day can significantly influence on the measured serum TSH 
concentrations.
2
Other Factors
: Genetics, Poisonous substances and radiation exposure, Inflammation of the thyroid gland, Deficiency or excess of iodine in the 
diet, Pregnancy, Certain medications 
– 
antidepressants, cholesterol lowering drugs, chemotherapy drugs, steroids, Thyroid cancer.

For the diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency it is recommended to have clinical correlation with serum 25
(OH)vitamin D, serum calcium, serum PTH & serum alkaline phosphatase.
During the monitoring of oral vitamin D therapy - suggested testing of serum 25(OH)vitamin D is after 12 
weeks or 3 months of treatment. However, the required dosage of vitamin D supplements & time to achieve 
sufficient vitamin D levels show significant seasonal (especially winter) & individual variability depending on 
age, body fat, sun exposure, physical activity, genetic factors (especially variable vitamin D receptor 
responses), associated liver or renal disease, malabsorption syndromes and calcium or magnesium 
deficiency influencing the vitamin D metabolism.
