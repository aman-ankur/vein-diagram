- Optimize content chunks for Claude API calls
- Token estimation and reduction
- Modify process_pages_sequentially to use chunks
- Optimize token usage metrics
- **DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION** (December 2024)

### Phase 3: Adaptive Context ðŸ”„ PLANNED  
- Context-aware extraction across API calls
- Adaptive prompt templates

## Integration Points

The document structure analysis integrates with the existing pipeline at these key points:

```
process_pdf_background
  â”œâ”€â”€ extract_text_from_pdf
  â”œâ”€â”€ analyze_document_structure  <-- New addition
  â”œâ”€â”€ filter_relevant_pages       <-- Modified to use structure
  â””â”€â”€ process_pages_sequentially  <-- Modified to use structure
       â””â”€â”€ extract_biomarkers_with_claude <-- Modified to use adaptive prompts
```

## Feature Toggles

The feature can be controlled through the `DOCUMENT_ANALYZER_CONFIG` in `config.py`:

```python
DOCUMENT_ANALYZER_CONFIG = {
    "enabled": True,                # Master toggle for all features
    "structure_analysis": {
        "enabled": True,            # Enable structure analysis
        "fallback_to_legacy": True  # Fall back if analysis fails
    },
    "content_optimization": {
        "enabled": True,            # Enable content optimization
        "token_reduction_target": 0.4 # Target 40% token reduction
    },
    "adaptive_context": {
        "enabled": True,            # Enable adaptive context
        "confidence_threshold": 0.7 # Confidence threshold for adaptive prompts
    }
}
```

## Metrics & Validation

We plan to track the following metrics to validate the effectiveness:

- **Token Usage**: Before vs. after optimization
- **Extraction Accuracy**: F1 score compared to baseline
- **False Positive Rate**: Reduction in incorrect biomarker extractions
- **Processing Time**: Impact on overall processing speed
- **Confidence Scores**: Distribution of confidence in extracted biomarkers

## Testing Strategy

For each phase, we'll implement:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete extraction pipeline
4. **A/B Tests**: Compare with existing pipeline using real documents

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Table detection robustness improved, but still depends on PDF structure quality
- Zone classification is approximate and may need refinement for complex layouts
- Token estimation without tiktoken is approximate
- Current implementation prioritizes accuracy over processing speed

## Future Enhancements

- Improve table extraction accuracy with custom extraction algorithms
- Add machine learning-based document classification
- Implement caching of common document structures
- Add visualization tools for document structure analysis
- Consider adding heatmap visualization of biomarker confidence regions
- Implement interactive debugging mode for structure detection tuning
