# Vein Diagram: Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Vein Diagram addresses a critical gap in personal health management: the disconnect between receiving medical test results and actually understanding them in a meaningful context. Blood test results are typically delivered as static PDFs with raw numbers that fail to provide:

1. Historical context (how values have changed over time)
2. Relational insights (how different biomarkers influence each other)
3. Personalized interpretation (what these values mean for an individual's health)

This project exists to transform these static, often confusing documents into dynamic, insightful visualizations that empower users to take control of their health data and make informed decisions.

## Problems Solved

### For Health-Conscious Individuals
- **Data Fragmentation**: Consolidates scattered test results from different labs and time periods into a single, coherent system
- **Manual Data Entry**: Eliminates tedious and error-prone manual entry of biomarker values
- **Trend Blindness**: Reveals patterns and trends that would be invisible when looking at individual test results
- **Context Deficit**: Provides research-backed explanations about what biomarker values actually mean

### For Biohackers
- **Experiment Tracking**: Enables precise tracking of how interventions affect specific biomarkers
- **Correlation Discovery**: Helps identify unexpected relationships between different health indicators
- **Optimization Insights**: Facilitates data-driven health optimization through clear visualization of cause and effect

### For Patients with Chronic Conditions
- **Condition Monitoring**: Simplifies the tracking of condition-specific biomarkers over time
- **Treatment Effectiveness**: Shows clear evidence of whether treatments are working as expected
- **Early Warning System**: Highlights concerning trends before they become serious health issues

## How It Should Work

### User Flow
1. **Upload**: User uploads PDF blood test results from supported lab providers
2. **Extraction**: System automatically extracts biomarker data, dates, and reference ranges
3. **Visualization**: Data is transformed into intuitive visualizations showing trends over time
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Connections between related biomarkers are displayed
5. **Contextual Insights**: AI-powered explanations provide meaning and context for the data
6. **Continued Use**: As users upload more test results, the system builds a more comprehensive health picture

### Key Functionality
- PDF parsing with high accuracy across different lab formats
- Time-series visualization of biomarker trends
