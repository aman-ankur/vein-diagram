# Vein Diagram: Project Brief

## Vision
Vein Diagram is a specialized web application that transforms blood test PDFs into insightful visualizations, enabling users to track biomarkers over time, identify trends, and understand relationships between different health indicators. The platform bridges the gap between raw lab data and meaningful health insights by leveraging modern data visualization techniques and AI-powered analysis.

## Problem Statement
Health-conscious individuals, biohackers, and patients with chronic conditions receive blood test results as static PDFs that make it difficult to:
- Track changes in biomarkers over time
- Visualize connections between different health indicators
- Identify concerning patterns before they become serious
- Access a holistic view of their health through intuitive visualizations
- Understand biomarker relationships through research-backed insights

Currently, these individuals resort to manual data entry into spreadsheets or disconnected apps, leading to inconsistent tracking, data entry errors, and missed insights that could be revealed through proper visualization and correlation analysis.

## Core Innovation
Vein Diagram's unique value proposition is its ability to:
1. **Extract & Organize**: Automatically extract biomarker data from PDF lab reports
2. **Visualize Trends**: Present time-series data in aesthetically pleasing visualizations
3. **Show Relationships**: Map connections between different biomarkers
4. **Provide Context**: Leverage Claude API to deliver research-backed explanations about biomarker relationships and meanings
5. **Focus on Design**: Create a premium visual experience that makes health data more approachable and meaningful

## Target Users
- Health-conscious individuals who get regular blood tests (quarterly/biannually)
- Biohackers tracking specific markers through experimentation
- Patients managing chronic conditions who need to monitor specific biomarkers
- Age range: 18-50, moderately to highly tech-savvy

## Project Goals
1. Create an MVP in one week that demonstrates core functionality
2. Focus on a clean, maintainable architecture that can be extended later
3. Prioritize the PDF parsing and visualization components
4. Integrate Claude API for enhanced biomarker insights
5. Build a solid foundation that can be expanded with authentication and more advanced features in later versions

## Success Metrics
- Successful extraction of biomarker data from major lab providers (Quest, LabCorp)
- Accurate visualization of biomarker trends over time **per profile**
- Clear presentation of biomarker relationships
- Contextual explanations of biomarker meanings and correlations
- **Correct association of uploaded PDFs and favorites with specific user profiles**
- Positive user feedback on visualization quality, insight value, and profile management usability
