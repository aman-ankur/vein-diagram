## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Under Consideration

1. **PDF Processing Approach**:
   - **Current Approach**: Using a combination of PyMuPDF and pdfplumber for text extraction
   - **Consideration**: Whether to add OCR capabilities using pytesseract for image-based PDFs
   - **Trade-offs**: Improved coverage vs. increased processing time and complexity

2. **Data Visualization Library**:
   - **Current Approach**: Using D3.js for custom visualizations
   - **Consideration**: Whether to switch to a React-specific library like Recharts for better integration
   - **Trade-offs**: Flexibility and power vs. ease of implementation and maintenance

3. **State Management**:
   - **Current Approach**: Using React's built-in state management with context
   - **Consideration**: Whether to introduce Redux or another state management library
   - **Trade-offs**: Simplicity vs. scalability for more complex state requirements

4. **Authentication Strategy**:
   - **Current Approach**: No authentication for MVP
   - **Consideration**: Planning for future authentication implementation
   - **Trade-offs**: Development speed vs. future rework

### UX Considerations

1. **Visualization Complexity**:
   - **Challenge**: Balancing comprehensive data display with simplicity and clarity
   - **Consideration**: How to present complex biomarker relationships without overwhelming users
   - **Approach**: Progressive disclosure of information, with basic views by default and detailed options available

2. **PDF Upload Experience**:
   - **Challenge**: Managing user expectations during potentially lengthy processing times
   - **Consideration**: How to provide feedback during processing
   - **Approach**: Implementing a multi-stage progress indicator with estimated completion times

3. **Biomarker Context**:
   - **Challenge**: Providing meaningful context for biomarker values
   - **Consideration**: How to balance scientific accuracy with understandable explanations
   - **Approach**: Using Claude API to generate layered explanations with both simple summaries and detailed scientific context

### Current Blockers

1. **PDF Format Variability**:
   - **Issue**: Wide variation in how different labs format their PDF reports
   - **Impact**: Challenges in creating a universal parser
   - **Mitigation**: Building a modular parsing system with format-specific adapters

2. **Reference Range Standardization**:
   - **Issue**: Different labs use different reference ranges for the same biomarkers
   - **Impact**: Difficulty in providing consistent visualization of "normal" ranges
   - **Mitigation**: Creating a normalized reference range database with source attribution

3. **Visualization Performance**:
   - **Issue**: Rendering complex visualizations with large datasets can impact performance
   - **Impact**: Potential for poor user experience on less powerful devices
   - **Mitigation**: Implementing data sampling, progressive loading, and optimization techniques
