        *   **Solution**: Comprehensive filtering system with 100+ invalid patterns covering administrative data, geographic info, qualitative results
        *   **Implementation**: Enhanced prompts with explicit valid/invalid examples, improved fallback parser with extensive pattern filtering
        *   **Result**: Eliminated extraction of non-biomarker text, significantly improved accuracy
    *   **Claude Model Updates**:
        *   **Problem Solved**: Using deprecated Claude models (`claude-3-sonnet-20240229`)
        *   **Solution**: Updated to latest models (`claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`) in both biomarker and metadata parsers
        *   **Result**: Improved extraction accuracy and future-proofed API calls
    *   **Enhanced Error Handling**:
        *   **Improvement**: Advanced JSON repair logic handling common Claude API response errors and truncation
        *   **Result**: Higher success rate for LLM-based extraction, reduced fallback to regex parser
    *   **Testing & Validation**:
        *   **Created**: Comprehensive test suites for smart chunk skipping (19 tests) and biomarker caching (17 tests)
        *   **Created**: `test_real_pdf_extraction.py` for real-world validation with detailed performance metrics
        *   **Confirmed**: Cache persistence fix validated with real documents showing 125+ patterns learned and saved
        *   **Verified**: Smart processing optimizations working in both optimized and fallback processing paths
    *   **Database Cleanup**: Successfully removed problematic PDF records and associated biomarkers for clean testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Under Consideration

1.  **State Management for Profile Context**:
    *   **Current Approach**: Likely using React Context or simple prop drilling for now.
    *   **Consideration**: Whether a more robust state management library (like Zustand or Redux Toolkit) is needed as complexity grows with profile switching affecting multiple components.
    *   **Trade-offs**: Simplicity vs. scalability and maintainability.
    *   **Status**: Monitoring complexity during integration.

2.  **Data Fetching Strategy**:
    *   **Current Approach**: Fetching data on component mount or user action.
    *   **Consideration**: Optimizing data fetching when switching profiles frequently. Caching strategies per profile.
    *   **Trade-offs**: Performance vs. data freshness.
    *   **Status**: Implementing basic fetching first, optimizing later based on performance testing.

3.  **Data Visualization Library**: (Ongoing)
    *   **Current Approach**: Using D3.js for custom visualizations. Recharts/Chart.js potentially for simpler charts.
    *   **Consideration**: Still evaluating the best fit for relationship mapping complexity vs. ease of integration.
    *   **Status**: Proceeding with D3 for complex views, may use others for simpler ones.

4.  **Health Score Calculation Logic**:
    *   **Current Approach**: Likely a weighted average or rule-based system using `optimal_ranges.json`.
    *   **Consideration**: Refining the weighting, factors included, and explanation generation. How to handle missing data? How to show trends?
    *   **Trade-offs**: Simplicity vs. clinical accuracy/nuance.
    *   **Status**: Initial implementation done, needs refinement and testing.

### UX Considerations

1.  **Profile Switching Clarity**:
    *   **Challenge**: Ensuring users always know which profile's data they are viewing.
    *   **Approach**: Prominent display of the active profile, clear visual cues during switching.
    *   **Status**: Design and implementation ongoing.

2.  **Managing Favorites**:
    *   **Challenge**: Making the process of adding/removing/reordering favorites intuitive across different contexts (tiles, table, modals).
    *   **Approach**: Consistent iconography (star, x), drag-and-drop for tiles, modals for adding/replacing. Backend persistence.
    *   **Status**: Implemented. Minor UI tweaks might be needed based on feedback.

3.  **Onboarding for New Features**:
    *   **Challenge**: Introducing users to profile management and favorites without overwhelming them.
    *   **Approach**: Contextual hints or a brief guided tour upon first encountering the features.
    *   **Approach**: Contextual hints or a brief guided tour upon first encountering the features. **Implemented a dedicated Welcome Page for first-time users (0 profiles).**
    *   **Status**: **Implemented**.

4.  **Health Score Presentation**:
    *   **Challenge**: Displaying the score and its components clearly without being overly simplistic or complex.
    *   **Approach**: Dedicated components for score, explanation, factors, and trends.
    *   **Status**: Components created, integration and refinement needed.

### Current Blockers

1.  **Frontend Integration Complexity**:
    *   **Issue**: Integrating the profile context deeply into existing pages (`BiomarkerHistoryPage`, `VisualizationPage`) requires significant refactoring.
    *   **Impact**: Slows down the delivery of a fully profile-aware user experience.
    *   **Mitigation**: Breaking down the integration into smaller, manageable steps. Prioritizing core data display first.
    *   **Status**: In progress, primary focus currently.

2.  **PDF Format Variability**: (Ongoing)
    *   **Issue**: While improved, new or unusual PDF formats can still pose extraction challenges.
    *   **Impact**: Affects data accuracy for some users.
    *   **Mitigation**: Continuous improvement of Claude prompts and fallback parser logic based on reported issues.
    *   **Status**: Managed, but requires ongoing attention.

3.  **Claude API Rate Limits/Costs**: (Ongoing)
    *   **Issue**: Potential bottleneck, especially if insights generation becomes heavy.
    *   **Mitigation**: Caching, prompt optimization, monitoring usage.
    *   **Status**: Mitigated by sequential processing, but individual page calls still have timeouts. Monitoring.

4.  **Health Score Calculation Performance**:
    *   **Issue**: Calculation might become slow if many biomarkers or complex logic is involved.
    *   **Impact**: Could slow down page loads where the score is displayed.
    *   **Mitigation**: Optimize calculation logic, consider caching scores, potentially calculate asynchronously.
    *   **Status**: Monitoring.
5.  **Dashboard Rendering Issue**:
    *   **Issue**: The new `DashboardPage.tsx` component is not rendering visually for the user at the `/dashboard` route, despite code changes. The old summary view persists.
    *   **Impact**: Blocks progress on dashboard UI refinement and feature completion.
    *   **Mitigation**: Further investigation needed (build process, routing conflicts, conditional rendering elsewhere). Caching and server restart did not resolve.
    *   **Status**: **Blocker**. Needs investigation (build, cache, routing, conditional rendering). (Note: Empty state UX improved, but original rendering issue might persist).

6.  **New User Onboarding**:
    *   **Issue**: Users logging in for the first time were directed to a potentially empty/confusing dashboard.
    *   **Impact**: Poor initial user experience.
    *   **Mitigation**: Implemented a dedicated `/welcome` page (`WelcomePage.tsx`) shown only to users with zero profiles upon login or initial session load. This page guides them to create their first profile. Logic added to `AuthContext.tsx` to check profile count and redirect.
    *   **Status**: **Resolved**.

4. **Profile Merging Post-State**:
   * **Issue**: After merging profiles, localStorage references to deleted profiles can cause 404 errors.
   * **Impact**: Users may experience errors when returning to the app after profile merges.
   * **Mitigation**: Implemented automatic recovery that selects an available profile when the previous selection is no longer available.
   * **Status**: Resolved with enhanced error handling in ProfileContext.
