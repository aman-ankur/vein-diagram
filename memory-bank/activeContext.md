   - **Current Approach**: No authentication for MVP
   - **Consideration**: Planning for future authentication implementation
   - **Trade-offs**: Development speed vs. future rework
   - **Status**: Deferred to post-MVP phase

### UX Considerations

1. **Visualization Complexity**:
   - **Challenge**: Balancing comprehensive data display with simplicity and clarity
   - **Consideration**: How to present complex biomarker relationships without overwhelming users
   - **Approach**: Progressive disclosure of information, with basic views by default and detailed options available
   - **Status**: Design phase, implementing basic views first

2. **PDF Upload Experience**:
   - **Challenge**: Managing user expectations during potentially lengthy processing times
   - **Consideration**: How to provide feedback during processing
   - **Approach**: Implemented multi-stage progress indicators with background processing
   - **Status**: Basic implementation complete, refining based on testing

3. **Biomarker Context**:
   - **Challenge**: Providing meaningful context for biomarker values
   - **Consideration**: How to balance scientific accuracy with understandable explanations
   - **Approach**: Using Claude API to generate layered explanations with both simple summaries and detailed scientific context
   - **Status**: Planning phase, developing prompts for Claude API

### Current Blockers

1. **PDF Format Variability**:
   - **Issue**: Wide variation in how different labs format their PDF reports
   - **Impact**: Some lab formats still present challenges for extraction
   - **Mitigation**: Using Claude API with fallback pattern matching has improved coverage
   - **Status**: Significantly improved but monitoring edge cases

2. **Reference Range Standardization**:
   - **Issue**: Different labs use different reference ranges for the same biomarkers
