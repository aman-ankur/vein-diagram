   * Test edge cases with various biomarker profiles and scenarios

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions for Next Phase

1. **Cost Management Strategy**:
   * **Current Approach**: Real-time monitoring with 70% token reduction
   * **Consideration**: Should we implement hard usage limits or focus on further optimization?
   * **Trade-offs**: User experience vs. cost control
   * **Status**: Monitoring production usage to inform decision

2. **Conversation Intelligence**:
   * **Current Approach**: Context-aware responses with biomarker highlighting
   * **Consideration**: How much conversation history should influence future responses?
   * **Trade-offs**: Personalization depth vs. computational complexity
   * **Status**: Collecting user feedback to guide enhancement priorities

3. **Feature Expansion Priority**:
   * **Current Approach**: Core chatbot with biomarker context and cost optimization
   * **Consideration**: Next features - Health Score integration, export, or advanced analytics?
   * **Trade-offs**: Feature breadth vs. depth of existing capabilities
   * **Status**: User feedback will guide feature roadmap

### User Experience Considerations

1. **Response Quality vs. Speed**:
   * Balancing comprehensive answers with fast response times
   * Current 350-token limit maintains quality while optimizing costs
   * May adjust based on user feedback and usage patterns

2. **Conversation Persistence**:
   * Current localStorage approach works well for privacy
   * Considering cloud sync for multi-device access
   * Privacy concerns vs. convenience trade-offs

3. **Mobile Optimization**:
   * Current responsive design works across devices
   * May enhance mobile-specific features based on usage analytics
   * Touch interactions and typing experience continually refined
