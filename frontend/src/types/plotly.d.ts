// Add type declarations for modules that don't have official @types packages

declare module 'plotly.js-basic-dist';

// If you encounter issues with react-plotly.js/factory, you might add:
// declare module 'react-plotly.js/factory'; 
// However, installing @types/react-plotly.js should ideally cover this.
