# Vein Diagram: Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### Data Capture & Processing
1. Allow users to upload PDF lab reports
2. Extract text from PDFs using OCR (for image-based PDFs) and text extraction (for text-based PDFs)
3. Parse extracted text to identify biomarkers, values, and units
4. Organize biomarkers into logical categories (Blood Count, Metabolic, etc.)
5. Store biomarker data with timestamps for trend analysis
6. Enable correction of any incorrectly parsed data

### Visualization
1. Generate interactive time-series visualizations for biomarkers
2. Display reference ranges (normal/abnormal) on visualizations
3. Create network graphs showing correlations between biomarkers
4. Ensure all visualizations are mobile-responsive
5. Optimize visualization rendering for performance
6. Apply premium design aesthetics to all charts and graphs

### Analysis & Insights
1. Calculate correlations between different biomarkers
2. Generate research-backed insights explaining biomarker relationships
3. Highlight significant changes in biomarker values over time
4. Provide educational content on common biomarkers

### User Interface
1. Create a mobile-responsive web interface
2. Implement intuitive upload and visualization workflows
3. Design with visual appeal as a priority
4. Provide clear navigation between different visualization types

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
1. Page load times under 2 seconds
2. Visualization render time under 1 second
3. PDF processing time under 30 seconds
4. Support concurrent users with minimal performance degradation

### Compatibility
1. Support modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
2. Ensure mobile-responsive design works on various screen sizes
3. Handle PDFs from major lab providers (Quest, LabCorp)

### Security
1. Implement secure file upload mechanisms
2. Store user data securely (though authentication is deferred to V2)
3. Ensure proper error handling and input validation

### Scalability
1. Design database schema for efficient querying as data grows
2. Optimize visualization generation for larger datasets
3. Structure the application for future feature additions
