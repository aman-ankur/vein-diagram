# Vein Diagram: Implementation Guide

## Development Approach

### Rapid Development Framework
- Focus on implementing core functionality first (PDF upload, parsing, basic visualization)
- Use Cursor AI to accelerate web app creation
- Prioritize simplicity over extensibility for MVP
- Implement features in vertical slices (complete one full feature before moving to the next)

### Development Phases
1. **Foundation Phase (Days 1-2)**
   - Set up project structure
   - Configure basic Frontend and Backend
   - Implement PDF upload functionality
   - Create database schema

2. **Data Processing Phase (Days 2-3)**
   - Implement PDF text extraction
   - Set up Claude API integration
   - Create parsing logic for biomarker data
   - Add data validation and correction interface

3. **Visualization Phase (Days 4-5)**
   - Implement time-series visualization
   - Create correlation network graph
   - Add interactive features to visualizations
   - Optimize for mobile responsiveness

4. **Insights Phase (Days 6-7)**
   - Implement Claude API for insights generation
   - Create insights display interface
   - Add basic educational content
   - Optimize performance and fix bugs

## Coding Standards

### Frontend Standards
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement PropTypes for component props
- Follow BEM methodology for CSS class naming
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibility
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Document complex components with JSDoc comments

### Backend Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use type hints for all functions
- Write comprehensive docstrings in Google style
- Create pure functions where possible
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Log all significant events and errors

### API Standards
- Use REST conventions for endpoint design
- Return consistent JSON response structure
- Include appropriate HTTP status codes
- Validate all input data
- Document all endpoints with examples

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test core functions in isolation
- Focus on PDF parsing logic
- Test visualization data generation
- Use pytest for backend tests
- Use Jest for frontend component tests

### Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints
- Verify database operations
- Test PDF processing pipeline end-to-end
- Validate visualization rendering

### Manual Testing
- Verify mobile responsiveness
- Test with various PDF report formats
- Validate visualization interactivity
- Check cross-browser compatibility

## Error Handling

### Frontend Error Handling
- Implement error boundaries for React components
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Add retry mechanisms for API calls
- Validate form inputs before submission

### Backend Error Handling
- Use try-except blocks with specific exceptions
- Log errors with stack traces
- Return appropriate HTTP error codes
- Provide meaningful error messages in API responses

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Performance
- Lazy load components
- Optimize bundle size
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Implement virtualization for long lists

### Backend Performance
- Cache frequent queries
- Optimize database indexes
- Use async processing for PDF parsing
- Implement request timeouts

## Security Considerations

### Data Security
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Implement file type validation
- Use secure file upload best practices
- Don't store sensitive personal information in V1

### API Security
- Rate limit API endpoints
- Validate request parameters
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Prepare for authentication in V2

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Local development with hot reloading
- Use Docker Compose for local services
- Implement Git workflow with feature branches

### Staging Environment
- Deploy to cloud provider with minimal resources
- Implement continuous integration
- Run automated tests before deployment

### Production Environment
- Deploy to scalable cloud infrastructure
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Implement automated backups
- Configure auto-scaling for future growth



Development Approach and Coding Standards
The development approach includes:

Agile methodology with iterative feedback.
Test-Driven Development (TDD) for reliability.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for automation.
Coding standards:

Clean, maintainable code with comprehensive documentation.
Use type hints in Python, follow PEP 8, and React best practices.
Modular functions with single responsibilities, thorough error handling.
Testing:

Unit tests for backend functions using unittest or pytest.
Integration tests for API endpoints and database interactions.
End-to-end tests using Selenium or Cypress for user workflows.
Specific guidelines:

FastAPI: Use async functions, clear routes, dependency injection.
React: Functional components with hooks, effective state management.
Database: Use SQLAlchemy, ensure proper indexing for fast queries.
External services: Secure API keys, error handling, retries.
