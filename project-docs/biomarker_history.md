# Biomarker History Feature: PRD & Technical Specification

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Overview
The Biomarker History feature will allow users to view all their biomarkers across multiple uploaded lab reports in a single, consolidated interface. This will enable users to track changes in their biomarker values over time and across different lab reports.

### Problem Statement
Currently, users can only view biomarkers from a single lab report at a time, making it difficult to:
- Track biomarker trends over time
- Compare results across different lab tests
- Get a comprehensive view of their health data history

### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to see all my biomarkers from all uploaded reports so I can track my health metrics over time.
2. As a user, I want to filter biomarkers by category, date range, or status so I can focus on specific areas of interest.
3. As a user, I want to sort biomarkers by various parameters so I can analyze them effectively.
4. As a user, I want to know which lab report each biomarker came from so I can understand the context of each measurement.
5. As a user, I want to see when each biomarker was measured (sample date) so I can track changes chronologically.

### Key Features
1. **Consolidated Biomarker View**: A tabular display of all biomarkers from all reports
2. **Source Information**: Clear indication of which report each biomarker came from
3. **Temporal Context**: Display of report generation/sample date for each biomarker
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter options for categories, date ranges, report names, and status
5. **Sorting Capability**: Ability to sort by biomarker name, value, date, status, etc.
6. **Deduplication**: Elimination of duplicate biomarkers from the same report

### Success Metrics
1. User engagement with the history view (time spent, frequency of access)
2. Reduction in switching between individual report views
3. User feedback and satisfaction ratings
