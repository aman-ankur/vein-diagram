# Product Requirements Document: Vein Diagram (Revised)

<prd>
  <problem_statement>
    Health-conscious individuals, biohackers, and patients with chronic conditions regularly receive blood test results in PDF format that are difficult to track over time. These reports contain valuable biomarker data, but without proper tools to extract, organize, and visualize this information, users cannot easily:
    
    - Identify trends in their biomarkers over time
    - Visualize connections between different biomarkers
    - Spot concerning patterns before they become serious health issues
    - Understand their overall health picture through elegant data visualization
    - Access research-backed insights about biomarker relationships
    
    Currently, these individuals resort to manual data entry into spreadsheets or disconnected apps, leading to inconsistent tracking, data entry errors, and missed insights that could be revealed through proper visualization and correlation analysis.
